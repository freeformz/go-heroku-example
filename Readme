This is a sample hello world Go app to illustrate what you'd get by
following the guide at
http://mmcgrana.github.com/2012/09/getting-started-with-go-on-heroku.html
Additionally, there are extra packages to illustrate a Go app that
contains more than one package and more than one command.

You can deploy it to heroku with the following commands:

$ git clone https://github.com/kr/go-heroku-example.git
$ cd go-heroku-example
$ heroku create -b https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go.git
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
